# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this sapplication is function as awebsite where the user can navigate through clothes in order to purchase any item they woudld
like
### Usability Principles Considered
Tried to make sure that all the things utilized could all be reached easily or at least seen easily which is why I added filters for each
of the type if items
### Organization of Components
I centered all the items in the cart so that the user has a clear understanding the area/zone which they will be retrieving the items from.
I also gave the column to the left a different color to indicate that that are is not used for the same thing.
### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Here we have parameters that function to pass information such as the current state or the necessary information to create a certain part of 
the website.
### How the User Triggers State Changes
The State changes depednign on speciic buttons clicked such as adding items to the cart or checking for specifc items 
instead of looking at the whole shopping list.
